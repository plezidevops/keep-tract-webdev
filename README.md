# My daily Web development Challenges

Welcome to my My daily Web development challenges!

I'm committed at least 20 minutes, every day, doing web development related work, rain, sun shine, snow, or whatever.

## My Rules

1. I will push my works to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.

2. I will update my [Activity Log](log.md) with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.

## Contents

The stuff I create, such as diagrams, scripts, installation manuals will be stored here. It will contain invaluable documents for others who wishes to duplicate my work:

- [Daily activity Log](log.md)
- [Resources](resources.md)
