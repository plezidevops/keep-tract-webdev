### Day 1 (10/12/23) - Introduction to HTML

**Focus**: Today's learning focuses on getting familiar with HTML

**Progress**:

- The learning today focuses on these tags
  - Heading
  - Paragraph
  - Void elements

**Thoughts**: This is a review for me. The approach is learning by doing. The author presented the theory on the tags. Then provides lessons to practice the learning. I got to play around with the tags to understand the effect. pretty cool!!! Keep learning.

**Work & Resources**:

- NONE
